          The General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) The GDPR regulates privacy
          policy requirements for entities targeting users in the European Union
          (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), regardless of the company’s
          physical location. Your business must comply with the GDPR if it
          targets EU consumers and meets one of the following thresholds: It
          offers goods or services It monitors online behavior Chapter 3,
          Articles 13 and 14 of the law clarify that users have the right to be
          fully informed about the collection and use of their personal data.
          Linking to a generic privacy policy is not enough under the GDPR; you
          also need freely given consent from users before collecting their
          personal information. Under the law, personal data refers to any
          information relating to an identifiable person, either directly or
          indirectly. It’s important to note that different privacy laws use
          unique definitions for personal information, each with slight
          variations in meaning. Your business can communicate all relevant data
          gathering and processing information in compliance with the GDPR and
          request user consent by publishing a privacy policy on your website.
          The penalties for GDPR non-compliance are fines of up to 4% of your
          annual global turnover or €24 million ($23 million), whatever is
          highest. The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) The CCPA
          regulates privacy policy requirements for businesses targeting users
          in California, regardless of the company’s physical location. Your
          business falls under the CCPA if it meets one of the following
          thresholds: It generates over $25 million in annual gross revenue It
          annually buys, receives, sells, or shares the personal information of
          50,000 or more consumers (changing to 100,000 under the CPRA) It
          derives 50% or more of its annual revenue from the sale of personal
          consumer data Under the law, you must inform users about the personal
          data you collect and how it’s processed. The text of the CCPA defines
          personal data similarly to the GDPR but excludes publicly available
          information, like social media posts. You must also provide a way for
          consumers to opt out of the sale of their data. To comply with the
          CCPA, you can outline your data practices with our standard privacy
          policy template and include a conspicuous “Do Not Sell My Personal
          Information” link. The penalties for CCPA non-compliance are fines of
          $2,5000 per violation or $7,500 per intentional violation.
